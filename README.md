# EXP-3-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: 
ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta
Experiment:
Within a specific use case (e.g., summarizing text, answering technical questions), compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of prompting tools across these different AI platforms.

## Algorithm:
**Step 1: Define the Evaluation Scope and Objectives**

  1.1 Objective: Clearly state the purpose of the evaluation. Is it to find the best tool for a specific task, or to understand the general strengths and weaknesses of each platform?

  1.2 Platforms: Identify the specific AI platforms to be evaluated: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cohere Command, and Meta.

  1.3 Use Cases: Select and define the specific tasks for the evaluation. For each use case, describe the ideal outcome.

  Use Case A: Summarizing Text: Define the type of text (e.g., a news article, a research paper, a long email chain) and the desired summary length/style (e.g., a concise paragraph, a list of bullet points).

  Use Case B: Answering Technical Questions: Define the complexity and domain of the questions (e.g., a Python debugging problem, a question about a specific machine learning model, a question on cloud architecture).

**Step 2: Develop Standardized Prompts and Test Cases**

  2.1 Create Prompts: For each use case, create a set of at least 3-5 identical prompts. The prompts should be carefully worded to avoid ambiguity and should be consistent across all platforms.

  2.2 Standardize Input: Use the exact same input text, code snippets, or questions for all platforms. For example, if evaluating summarization, use the same article for all tools.

  2.3 Track Metadata: Create a spreadsheet or document to record the following for each test: Platform, Use Case, Prompt Text, Input Data, and Date.

**Step 3: Define Evaluation Criteria**

  3.1 Performance Metrics (Quantitative):

  Response Time: How long does it take for the AI to generate a full response?

  Length: Is the output within the desired length constraints?

  Factuality/Accuracy: Is the information provided correct and free of hallucinations?

  3.2 User Experience (Qualitative):

  Interface Ease: How easy and intuitive is it to interact with the platform?

  Clarity of Response: Is the output well-structured, easy to read, and free of jargon?

  Flexibility: Does the platform allow for easy editing of prompts, or providing follow-up instructions?

  3.3 Response Quality (Subjective/Qualitative):

  Coherence & Flow: Does the text read naturally and logically?

**Step 4: Execute the Evaluation Test**

 4.1 Systematic Testing: Go through each platform and run the identical set of prompts for each use case.

 4.2 Record Observations: Immediately after each test, record the AI's response and your qualitative and quantitative observations in your tracking document. Take screenshots of the interfaces if necessary.


**Step 5: Analyze and Synthesize Results**

  5.1 Data Aggregation: Compile all the recorded data into a single location.

  5.2 Comparative Analysis: Compare the results side-by-side. Look for patterns and trends. For example, did one platform consistently summarize faster? Did another provide more accurate technical answers?

  5.3 Identify Strengths & Weaknesses: Based on your analysis, document the specific strengths and weaknesses of each platform for each use case.

  5.4 Formulate a Conclusion: Draft a final conclusion summarizing your findings. Rank the platforms for each use case based on your defined criteria.

## Prompt:
Compare ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta AI on the same tasks (e.g., summarization, technical Q&A). For each platform, follow Prompt and compare accuracy, clarity, depth, and user experience.
